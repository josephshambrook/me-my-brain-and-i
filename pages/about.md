It’s hard to lead a cavalry charge if you think you look funny on a horse.

 

When I felt my motivation lagging at university, I turned to inspirational quotes. This one in particular has stuck with me, because it brings a funny image to my mind:

INSERT IMAGE



I developed seizures in the winter of 2010/11, and I was subsequently diagnosed with epilepsy in May 2011. At the time, I was attending university, which I was forced to drop out of. This made me feel lost, and I had no idea whether I would ever return. My seizures were very frequent, and at the time, I had so many worries and questions, and nowhere to turn to get answers.



10 years on, I am diagnosed with refractory epilepsy. Many of the challenges I faced then are the same today for people newly diagnosed with epilepsy. There is still a massive stigma around epilepsy, which must be broken.

 

Despite being personally outspoken about my epilepsy, if I were newly diagnosed today, I would wonder who the people with epilepsy are, who make their lives work. As kind as my doctors were, they were busy and couldn’t relate to me. Real people with epilepsy were the ones I wanted to ask questions such as:

* What is the best type of first aid to be given to seizures?
* What can trigger a seizure, and how do I find out my seizure triggers?
* What treatment options are there, if medication fails?
* Where do I begin with support if I’m a student?
* How can I begin to regain control of my life, and what tools have others used?

 

Incidentally, answers to all these questions will be covered in upcoming posts – sign up to the newsletter (link) to be the first to hear!

 

In refractory epilepsy, next to medication, lifestyle and trigger avoidance is relied on as a key part in seizure management. As such, whilst only 30% of people with epilepsy will be in the same boat as me, my hard-learned lessons will have value to anyone with epilepsy. This ranges tackling myths to how best to track seizures, all of which I learned from trial and error, but which you hopefully won’t have to.

 

I am grateful for my achievements, but there is no doubt in my mind that I have had to work exceptionally hard due to epilepsy. Despite my initial fears, I completed an undergraduate degree in social work in 2018, and I was awarded first class honours, but my short-term memory which only functions at 25%, which is direct result of epilepsy.

 

I now live in Edinburgh with my husband and 18-month-old daughter. In between working part-time, I maintain my website and chase my beautiful daughter around (another initial fear was that I would never be able to have a child). I am also learning to code in Swift using Playgrounds. In my spare time, I enjoy eating biscuits and drinking coffee, reading, and playing Dungeons and Dragons.
