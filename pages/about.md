It’s hard to lead a cavalry charge if you think you look funny on a horse.

When I felt my motivation lagging at university, I turned to inspirational quotes. This one in particular has stuck with me, because it brings a funny image to my mind:

I developed seizures in the winter of 2010/11, and I was subsequently diagnosed with epilepsy in May 2011. At the time, I was attending university, which I was forced to drop out of. This made me feel lost, and I had no idea whether I would ever return. My seizures were very frequent, and at the time, I had so many worries and questions, and I had nowhere to turn to get answers.

10 years on, I am diagnosed with refractory epilepsy. Many of the challenges I faced then are the same today for people newly diagnosed with epilepsy. There is still a massive stigma around epilepsy, which needs to be broken. In my own life, I have always been honest and outspoken about my epilepsy.

But if I were newly-diagnosed today, I would wonder who the people with epilepsy are, who are making their lives work and how they do it. When I was diagnosed, I wanted to ask someone experienced questions like:

(note to self, edit this list to include my better new blog posts)

* How can I tackle memory problems in my day to day tasks?
* I’m a student, where do I begin with support?
* What long-term treatment options are there, asides from medication?
* How can I tackle nausea as a side effect of medication?
* How do I tell my neurologist this medication isn’t working for me? (I once described myself as a guinea-pig)
* How can I deal with mental health challenges?
* How can I begin to combat the stigma around epilepsy?

And many, many more…

In my 10 years of having refractory epilepsy, completing a university degree, I have learned all I know to get by through trial and error, and picking pieces through trawling the internet. I would never claim to have learned it all, or even near a fraction of it. Key though, is that in refractory epilepsy, next to medication, lifestyle and trigger avoidance is relied on as a key part in seizure management. Therefore, only 30% of people with epilepsy are in the same boat as me, I genuinely believe that my hard-learned lessons will have value to anyone with epilepsy, as a lot of the advice applies across the whole condition, ranging from tackling myths to how best to track seizures.

I am very grateful to have overcome the obstacles I have done so far. I have completed an undergraduate degree in social work in 2018, where I was awarded first class honours. I now live in Edinburgh with my husband and 18-month-old daughter. In between working part-time, I post content to my website and chase my toddler around. I am also learning to code in Swift using Playgrounds. In my spare time, I enjoy eating more biscuits than is good for me (because who doesn’t love oreos), reading, and playing Dungeons and Dragons.

I can be contacted on the contact me page, on facebook, reddit, or twitter. Please do reach out with positive and negative comments alike.
